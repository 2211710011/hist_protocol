#　cFos and PV double immunostaining
with Fluoro Nissl counter (Floating)
## Injection
1. Mount isoflurane anesthetized rat on a stereotaxic frame.
2. Fill mineral oil into a Drummond glass capillary of which tip is 10-20 μm
3. Set the capillary onto the Nanoject II injector and fill 10% BDA solution about 1.0 μl.
4. Advance the capillary to the target brain region and wait for a while (> 5 min).
5. Inject total 0.3 μl BDA by applying 65 TTL pulses at 0.2 Hz (4.6 nl / impulse).
6. Wait for a while and retract the capillary gently.
7. Suture skins on the skull and house the rat normally for one week.
Perfusion and Sectioning
8. Transcardially perfuse with cool saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% picric 
acid with 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.2–7.3). Postfix overnight with the same fixative.
9. Section the brain via vibrating microtome into 40 to 50-μm-thick slices and harvest them in 24-well plates containing PBS.
## Antibody application (Room temperature, Light shielding)
10. PBS wash.
11 3% BSA in PBS-X, 30 min on shaker
12. 1st antibody mix in PBS-XBSA, ON on shaker
13. PBS-X wash (quick × 1, 10 min × 2)
14. 2nd antibody mix in PBS-X, 2 h on shaker
15. PBS-X wash (quick × 1, 10 min × 2)
16. PBS wash Mounting
17. Mount on gelatin-coated glass slides and Air-dry (30 min)
18. Circle with Liquid-blocker to make hydrophobic barrier
## Counterstaining with fluorescent Nissl
19. PBS, 10 min.
20. Diluted NeuroTrace (Blue), 40-60 min.
21. PBS wash (quick × 1, 10 min × 2)
## Coverslipping
22. Remove the hydrophobic barrier with KIMTECH wipes and cotton buds.
23. Coverslip with 50% (v/v) glycerol/2.5% (w/v) DABCO in PBS.
## Observation
24. Observe with epifluorescence or confocal microscopy.
