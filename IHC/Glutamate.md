# Glutamate (ImmunoStar) immunostaining with Fluoro Nissl counter (Floating) Donkey
Animals
1. If needed, 150 ug colchicine should be injected into lateral ventricle or targeted tissue two days before perfusion to enhance glutamate signals in the soma.
Perfusion, Agarose-embedding, Sectioning
2. Transcardially perfuse with saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.5% glutaraldehyde, and 0.2% picric acid with 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.2–7.3). Postfix overnight with the same fixative.
3. Remove the dura. If possible, the arachnoid membrane, the pia also.
4. Embed the brain into the 4% electrophoresis quality agarose.
5. Section the brain with vibrating blade microtome into 40-µm-thick slices and harvest them in 12 well plates containing PBS
Antibody application (Room temperature, Light shielding)
6. 10% NDS in PBS, 30 min on shaker
7. 1st antibody in PBS-D, 1 overnight on shaker
8. PBS wash (quick × 1, 10 min × 2)
9. 2nd antibody in PBS-D, 2 hr.
10. PBS wash (quick × 1, 10 min × 2)
11. PBS wash
Counterstaining with fluorescent Nissl
12. Diluted NeuroTrace (Blue), 40-60 min.
13. PBS wash (quick × 1, 10 min × 2)
Mounting
    14. Mount on gelatin-coated glass slides and Air-dry (30 min)
Coverslipping
15. Coverslip with 50% (v/v) glycerol/2.5% (w/v) DABCO in PBS.
Observation
16. Observe with epifluorescence or confocal microscopy.
