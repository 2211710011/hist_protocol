# CTB (List) retrograde tracing with Fluoro Nissl counter
(Floating) XD

## Injection
1. Mount isoflurane anesthetized rat on a stereotaxic frame.
2. Fill mineral oil into a Drummond glass capillary of which tip is 10-20 µm
3. Set the capillary onto the Nanoject II injector and fill 0.1-1.0% CTB solution about 1.0 µl.
4. Advance the capillary to the target brain region and wait for a while (> 5 min).
5. Inject total 0.1-0.5 µl CTB solution by applying 33-65 TTL pulses at 0.2 Hz (4.6 nl / impulse).
6. Wait for a while and retract the capillary gently.
7. Suture skins on the skull and house the rat normally for 2-4 days.

## Perfusion and Sectioning
8. Transcardially perfuse with cool saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% picric acid with 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.2–7.3). Postfix overnight with the same fixative.
9. Section the brain via vibrating microtome into 50 to 60-µm-thick slices and harvest them in 24-well plates containing PBS.

## Antibody application (Room temperature, Light shielding)
10. PBS wash.
11 10% NDS in PBS-X, 30 min on shaker
12. 1st antibody in PBS-XD, overnight on shaker
13. PBS-X wash (quick × 1, 10 min × 2)
14. 2nd antibody solution, 2 hr on shaker
15. PBS-X wash (quick × 1, 10 min × 2)
16. PBS wash

## Counterstaining with fluorescent Nissl
17. Diluted NeuroTrace (Blue), 40-60 min.
18. PBS wash (quick × 1, 10 min × 2)

## Mounting
19. Mount on gelatin-coated glass slides and Air-dry (30 min)

## Coverslipping
20. Coverslip with 50% (v/v) glycerol/2.5% (w/v) DABCO in PBS.

## Observation
21. Observe with epifluorescence or confocal microscopy.
